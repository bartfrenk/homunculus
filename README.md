Clojure library for sequential learning algorithms. Currently includes:
- sequential estimators for the mean and the standard deviation,
- beta conjugate priors for Bernoulli variables,
- strategies for bandit-type problems:
  - random probability matching, greedy and epsilon-greedy for the classical
    multi-armed bandit setting.
